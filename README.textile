h2. OCDSpec Templates for Projects and Targets

These templates are meant to make it easy to get started using and running OCDSpec Specs.  They are on the latest official release of OCDSpec.  If you wish to be on the bleeding edge, then manually install via the directions at: <a href="http://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec"> the main repo</a>.

h2.  Installation

The simplest thing is to use git to install them directly into the user template directory. 

Navigate to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates (if the Templates directory does not exist, create it)
git clone git://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec-Templates.git.  

This will create a directory called OCDSpec-Templates in your Templates directory.  In it run git submodule init and git submodule update to get OCDSpec.

h2. Using

This currently creates one template, A target project for running Unit Tests in an iPhone app.  Soon it will have a mac template and a file template for spec files.

h3. iPhone

After creating your application go to the build targets page and choose Add Target.  You will see an option for the iPhone Runner - add it.

When you build that project you should see "build succeeded".  You can now begin adding tests.  Use http://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec for how to get started with OCDSpec.

h3. Cocoa

Coming very soon.

h3. Creating Tests

Coming very soon.

h2.  Special Thanks

This repo is forked from borealkiss/Minimal-Template, who's work documenting the new XCode 4 template format was invaluable. 

See http://blog.boreal-kiss.net/2011/03/11/a-minimal-project-template-for-xcode-4/ if you are interested in creating your own.
