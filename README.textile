h2. OCDSpec Templates for Projects and Targets

These templates are meant to make it easy to get started using and running OCDSpec Specs

h2.  Installation

The simplest thing is to use git to install them directly into the user template directory. 

Navigate to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates (if the Templates directory does not exist, crate it)
git clone git://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec-Templates.git

This will create a directory called OCDSpec-Templates in your Templates directory.

h2. Using

This creates three templates:

* A target/project for running Unit Tests in an iPhone app
* A target/project for running Unit Tests in a Cocoa app
* A file template for creating tests.

h2.  Special Thanks

This repo is forked from borealkiss/Minimal-Template, who's work documenting the new XCode 4 template format was invaluable. 

See http://blog.boreal-kiss.net/2011/03/11/a-minimal-project-template-for-xcode-4/ if you are interested in creating your own.
