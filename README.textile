h2. OCDSpec Templates for Projects and Targets

These templates are meant to make it easy to get started using and running OCDSpec Specs.  They are on the latest official release of OCDSpec.  If you wish to be on the bleeding edge, then you can manually install via the directions at: <a href="http://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec"> the main repo</a> but I don't recommend it.

h2.  Installation

The simplest thing is to use git to install them directly into the user template directory. 

Navigate to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates (if the Templates directory does not exist, create it)
git clone git://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec-Templates.git.  
git submodule init
git submodule update

This will create a directory called OCDSpec-Templates in your Templates directory.

h2. Using

Three templates are created at this time.  One for setting up a Mac Spec Runner target, an iPhone Spec Runner target, and finally one for easily creating a spec.  Each of these can be used the same as any normal XCode template. 




h3. iPhone

After creating your application go to the build targets page and choose Add Target.  You will see an option for the iPhone Runner - add it.

When you build that project you should see "build succeeded".  You can now begin adding tests.  Use http://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec for how to get started with OCDSpec.

h3. Cocoa

Coming very soon.

h3. Creating Tests

h2.  Special Thanks

This repo is forked from borealkiss/Minimal-Template, who's work documenting the new XCode 4 template format was invaluable. 

See http://blog.boreal-kiss.net/2011/03/11/a-minimal-project-template-for-xcode-4/ if you are interested in creating your own.
